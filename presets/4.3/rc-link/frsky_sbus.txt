# Author: Chris Thompson ctzsnooze
# Description: Basic RC link settings for a 111hz / 9ms FrSky Sbus link, with the Rx bound in D16 mode with no more than 8 channels
# Description: These settings work best when used with a version of OpenTx with good module sync
# Description: Note: Telemetry requires smartPort (s.Port) and does not convey RSSI (use Lua or analog RSSI)
# Description: Note: When more than 8 channels are used, manual RC smoothing settings and two point averaging is required
# Description: Early versions of OpenTx with poor module sync will require two point averaging.
