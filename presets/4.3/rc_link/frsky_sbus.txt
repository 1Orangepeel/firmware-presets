# Title: FrSky Sbus

# Author: ctzsnooze
# Description: Basic RC link settings for a 111hz / 9ms FrSky Sbus link, with the Rx bound in D16 mode with no more than 8 channels
# Description: These settings work best when used with a version of OpenTx with good module sync
# Description: Note: Telemetry requires smartPort (s.Port) and does not convey RSSI (use Lua or analog RSSI)
# Description: Note: When more than 8 channels are bound, manual RC smoothing settings and two point averaging is required
# Description: Early versions of OpenTx with poor module sync will require two point averaging
# Description: Cell vs full voltage option affects which value will be sent by telemetry to the handset.  Default is per cell.
# Description: Units default to metric. Telemetry defaults to non-inverted and half-duple.  Both can be changed with checkbox
# Description: Other telemetry settings,eg gps format, default latitude and longitude, extra sensors, require manual CLI entries
# Description: Other options are provided for the intended flying style.
