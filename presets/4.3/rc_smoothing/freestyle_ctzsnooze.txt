# Description: RC smoothing settings for Freestyle footage
# Description: Fixed cutoff frequency for consistent, responsive results over a wide range of RC link frequencies. Auto-smoothing cutoff values are over-ridden by the fixed cutoff values.
# Description: There should be no need to turn off feedforward or to enable transition, beause the jitter reduction provides dynamic attenuation of feedforward whenever the sticks move slowly.
# Description: Option: Actual Rates, with centre sensitivity around 60 and 750 deg/s max.
