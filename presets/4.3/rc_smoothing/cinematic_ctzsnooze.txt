# Title: Cinematic RC smoothing
# FirmwareVersion: 4.3
# Category: RC_SMOOTHING
# Official: true
# Keywords: cinematic, rc, smoothing, rc_smoothing, jitter, transition, hd
# Author: ctzsnooze
# Description: Warning: will feel VERY 'soft' and unresponsive for small stick inputs!
# Description: Note: auto-smoothing values are over-ridden by manually configure cutoff values.
# Description: Option: enable Actual Rates, low centre sensitivity, no expo, 500 deg/s max
# Description: This preset provides RC smoothing settings for cinematic HD footage.  By using fixed cutoffs, it will give a consistent smooth stick feel across a wide range of RC link frequencies
# Description: There is no need to turn off feedforward; it should remain at values that give good stick responsiveness.
# Description: For even smoother stick feel, reduce rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 10 in CLI.  If too smooth, increase rc_smoothing_setpoint_cutoff and rc_smoothing_feedforward_cutoff to 20 in CLI.
