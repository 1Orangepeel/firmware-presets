# Description: RC smoothing settings for racing that slightly increases stick responsiveness over defaults. 
# Description: Note: this preset workse best with a locked-frequency RC link. 
# Description: Uses automatic cutoff adjustment that will optimise the cutoff to the link frequency at arming. As a result, faster RC links will feel more responsive. 
# Description: If sticks are too sensitive, increase the auto smoothing factors in the CLI. 
# Description: Note: If motors feel warmer than usual after applying this preset, return the auto RC smoothing values back to default of 30.
