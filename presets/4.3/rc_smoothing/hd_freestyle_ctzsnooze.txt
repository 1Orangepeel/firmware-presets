# Description: RC smoothing settings for smooth HD freestyle footage.
# Description: This preset uses fixed manual cutoff frequencies for consistent results over a wide range of RC link frequencies - the auto cutoff values are not used.
# Description: There is no need to turn off feedforward or to enable transition; jitter reduction provides dynamic attenuation of feedforward when sticks move slowly.
# Description: Option: Actual Rates, centre sensitivity around 30 deg/s, max rate 750 deg/s, with zero expo.
